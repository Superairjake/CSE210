"What is version control and why is it important?"

Maintaining an organized workspace is key to collaboration on a large project. 
Version control is the process of keeping various iterations of a project organized.
Typically version control will include tools that highlight updates and changes as well as who made them. 
Version control creates accountablilty within teams. 
Because each team member has a repository saved locally that can then be shared with their peers each member is able to operate independently. 
Once the changes have been shared with the main branch of code it is very easy to follow where changes or errors occur. 
The process of pushing a change would look like this:
"code is completed, within the terminal type 'git add .' which will stage your most recent files to be committed. 
Next you will type 'git commit -m "message" ' this will add a note to your updated code that will make organization much easier. 
The final step will be to type 'git push' in the terminal which will finalize the process of moving your code to the main repository.
